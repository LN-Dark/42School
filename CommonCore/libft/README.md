# LIBFT Project

This repository contains the implementation of the LIBFT library, which is a collection of useful functions in C. LIBFT is an essential project for the training of programmers, especially for those preparing for the programming exam at 42.

## Content

The LIBFT library includes:

- **String manipulation functions**
- **Memory allocation functions**
- **Conversion functions**
- **Linked list functions**
- **Implementation of `ft_printf`**

### ft_printf

The `ft_printf` function is an implementation of the famous `printf` function, which allows formatted output to the standard output. The implementation supports various format specifiers, providing flexibility in output formatting.

### get_next_line

The get_next_line function is designed to read and return the next line from a file descriptor. It operates as follows:

Input: A file descriptor (integer) from which to read data.

Output:

A string representing the next line, including the newline character (\n), if present.
Returns NULL when:
The end of the file is reached, and there is no more content to read.
An error occurs.
Behavior:

Reads data in chunks of a specified buffer size (e.g., 42 bytes).
Dynamically allocates memory to store the line.
Manages data left over from previous reads to ensure no part of the input is lost.
Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously (if implemented with support for this).
Common Challenges:

Efficiently handling very large files or lines.
Avoiding memory leaks by properly freeing unused memory.
Maintaining performance despite frequent dynamic memory operations.
Use Cases:

Processing text files line by line.
Handling input from a user in real-time.
Parsing network streams or log files.
Typically, get_next_line implementations are part of low-level coding exercises, where the goal is to practice managing pointers, memory, and file I/O.

### Linked Lists

The library also includes an implementation of linked lists, enabling dynamic data manipulation. The implemented functions allow you to create, add, remove, and iterate over the list elements.
