# LIBFT Project

This repository contains the implementation of the LIBFT library, which is a collection of useful functions in C. LIBFT is an essential project for the training of programmers, especially for those preparing for the programming exam at 42.

## Content

The LIBFT library includes:

- **String manipulation functions**
- **Memory allocation functions**
- **Conversion functions**
- **Linked list functions**
- **Implementation of `ft_printf`**

### ft_printf

The `ft_printf` function is an implementation of the famous `printf` function, which allows formatted output to the standard output. The implementation supports various format specifiers, providing flexibility in output formatting.

### Linked Lists

The library also includes an implementation of linked lists, enabling dynamic data manipulation. The implemented functions allow you to create, add, remove, and iterate over the list elements.
