# Piscine at 42 School

Welcome to the **Piscine** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide and resource hub for the Piscine program at **42 School**. The Piscine is an intensive coding bootcamp designed to introduce students to programming fundamentals in a collaborative environment.

## Overview

The Piscine is a month-long program where participants immerse themselves in coding, problem-solving, and peer learning. The experience is designed to build a strong foundation in programming, preparing students for future projects at 42 School.

## Objectives

During the Piscine, students will:
- Learn the basics of programming using C and other languages.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Collaborate with peers on coding challenges and projects.
- Gain hands-on experience through real-world coding scenarios.

## Structure

The Piscine consists of several key components:

1. **Coding Challenges:** A series of tasks that challenge students to apply their knowledge and enhance their coding skills.
2. **Projects:** Individual and group projects that mimic real-world programming situations, fostering collaboration and creativity.
3. **Peer Reviews:** Evaluation of peersâ€™ code, promoting constructive feedback and learning from one another.
4. **Workshops and Seminars:** Sessions focused on specific topics, languages, and tools to deepen understanding.

## Getting Started

To make the most of your Piscine experience, consider the following tips:

- **Familiarize Yourself with the Environment:** Get comfortable with the 42 coding environment and tools.
